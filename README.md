# Portfolio + Blog of Chris Cardoza

Each post is a markdown file in the `_posts` directory. It has many fields in the frontmatter to storea the metadata of the post. Every thing I think about, make or write is in its atomic form - a post. So if I wanted to create an about section, I would not create a new type or a new directory, I would just create a post with the title "About" and the content of the about page.
