As is mandatory for all firsts in the digital age, the greeting of _'Hello World'_ is a must for any surfer of the interwebs. The 'Time to Hello World' (TTHW) is a term coined by the spiders of the net. It strives to measure the amount of time it takes for an author to create a simple program in a given computer language. Lately, I have been wondering what my TTHW has been for things in life. For writing, it has been abysmal. Opening a blank page in a text editor, I will gladly spend hours debating the merits of sans serif or a serif font. I will weight the pros and cons of bold or italics. I will stare blankly at the mess that I have not created. I will do everything in my power to not write a single word. What changed this time? You are seeing this shit.

On this day, I am 24 years old, on a trajectory to become a quarter life crisis actor. Between the time I was born inside the internet and this moment, I have been through a lot. I will not bore you with the details. When approaching the 25 year mark, you start realizing that you need to reduce your TTHW. So, my futile attempts to write a single word have resulted in this first 'Hello World'.
