As is mandatory for all firsts in the digital age, the greeting of 'Hello World' is a must for any surfer of the interwebs. I have to be quite honest here, I am not a great writer, yet. So, hopefully, this will be a good start to my journey. Opening a blank page in a text editor, I will gladly spend hours debating the merits of sans serif or a serif font. I will weight the pros and cons of bold or italics. I will do everything in my power to not write a single word. So what changed here? We will have to put that discussion aside for a moment and revisit it later.

Between the time I was born inside the internet and this moment, I have been through a lot. I will not bore you with the details. What did change was that I decided to not not write a single word. And so it begins, the start of my terrible thoughts roaming the internet. The creepy crawlers of the web taking my words, encrypting them into little blobs of 1's and 0's, and then sending them to your eyes. Good luck seeing this shit. Actually, the real reason is that I purchased a domain name called chriscardoza.cc and I really want to make the best of it.
