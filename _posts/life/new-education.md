( This is a draft. )

## How did we get here?

Who made the current system? Was it the government? Was it the idea of a single person?

## Problems with the current system

If we look at the way classes are structured everywhere from the US to india and at every age, you see a problem. People with different backgrounds, preferences, and abilities are asked to follow the same curriculum in the same timeframe. Its like a binary classifier, at the end of the course, you either understood the material or you didnt. Maybe your parent died in the middle of the semester, ok too bad, you lose 3000.

## Possible solutions

Courses in universities where you get x% of your money back if you back out in a limited timeframe.

## Hypothesis
