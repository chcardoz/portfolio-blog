( This is a draft. )

1. Progress over perfection - The enemy of a good piece of work is the ideal that it will never satisfy.
2. The best ideas are forged not found - You can take an okay idea and make it better through rapid iteration.
3. Mistakes are not expensive if you learn fast enough - An optimal positive learning rate is one of the greatest secrets of the universe. If you move too fast, you will fail so badly that you will burnout and never start again. But if you learn too slow, each mistake will be a painful lesson.
4. Stealing and changing an idea is a great way to understand it - If you take someone's work and change it to be in your style, you have essentially understood what they were talking about.
5. "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." - Bruce Lee
6. Jack of all trades, master of none. Still better than a master of one.
7. Focusing on one project at a time will give you the capital to achieve the rest of your dreams. For example, before Stephen Hawking wrote books about space and time, he became a good physicist.
