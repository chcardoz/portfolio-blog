( This is a draft. )

Electrons and photons appear very differently in the classical world yet they are the same thing in the quantum world.

Electrons appear fundamental whereas photons are ripples in the EM field.
Shoudl we treat the particle as fundamental or the field?

QFT says that the field is fundamental and the particle is ripple in the field.

So why quantum field theory?

- Because the combinaton of special relativity and quantum mechanics implies that particle number is not conserved. First discoverd by Dirac with the introduction of the positron. Particles are created and destoryed and ephemeral.

Consider a mass trapped in a box of size $L$. Heisenberg tells us that the uncertainty in the momentum $\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2L}$. Uncertainty in the energy is on the order of $\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar c}{2L}$. When the uncertainty exceeds $\Delta E = 2mc^2$, particle anti-particle virtual pairs pop out of the vacuum. So if mass m is localized in a box of size $L = \hbar/4mc$. Length is called the Compton wavelength, at which point the concept of a particle breaks down.

Virtual particles are not measurable by an experiment, hence the name. So they can violate the laws of physics if they are not measurable, seems very convenient.

Why are there no errors in the proton production and a proton from a cosmic ray and one from a accelerator are identical.

# Clifford algebras

# Weyl algebras

# Fock space

Fermionic fock spaces ($F$) are naturally representations of Clifford algebras.
Bosonic fock spaces ($B$) are naturally representations of Weyl algebras.
How are these spaces related to the corresponding algebras and statistics?
